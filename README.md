# Data Structures in C++

This repository contains my implementations and exercises for various **Data Structures** in C++.  
It showcases fundamental data structures along with practical examples, focusing on both basic and advanced concepts.

## Topics Covered
- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees)
- Heaps and Priority Queues
- Hash Tables
- Graphs and Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS)
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms

## Repository Structure
- Each topic is organized into its own folder with well-documented C++ source files.
- Each file includes comments and examples demonstrating the concepts and their practical usage.

## Usage
Feel free to explore the implementations, modify the code, and use them as a learning reference.  
Contributions through issues or pull requests are welcome!  
This repository is designed to help learners strengthen their understanding of Data Structures in C++.
